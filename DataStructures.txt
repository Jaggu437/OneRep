Big O Notation - Long algorithm takes to run 
 O(1) - Just single element
 O(n) - for all the elements 
 O(n^2) - complex
 O(n) + O(n) = O(n)
 
 
 Stacks 
 
  - Push and Pop - LIFO - Last In First Out -> Like pack of tennis balls in vertical cylinder
  - Peek Method - can see last element on the stack 
 
 Queue - LIFO
 
 Add element using enqueue(), dequeue(), poll(),peek()
 
 LinkedList - When we need Faster Insertion
        Very fast removal - O(1)
        Slow retreival process O(n)


Array - Fast Lookup
